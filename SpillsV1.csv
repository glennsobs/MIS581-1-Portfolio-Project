After I talked with rick I traveled out to the location and proceeded to remove the bull plug from the wellhead at which the leak was coming from I cleaned the threads up and re thread taped and doped the plug and re installed the plug into the wellhead. The following morning we returned to location with a couple of bags of oil gator. We poured the oil gator onto the contaminated area around the wellhead and stirred it in to make sure of an even spread. We have since been back to stir and add more fresh oil gator around the wellhead and will continue to do so until the affected area appears remediated.

Initial investigation revealed gas was escaping from a 1inch line that is used periodically to pressure up a vapor line that runs from the tanks to the ECB to blow trapped fluid back into tank knock out pot. Gas pressure for this procedure is less than 40 pounds. Once Lease Operator relieved the trapped pressure on the 1 inch line the gas release stopped. Excavation of line revealed a corroded fitting on the line was allowing gas and fluid to be released when the line was pressured up.

Operator violated established procedure by not hanging his truck keys at the control panel, an aid intended to act as a reminder to shut off the pump.  Operator then left for the day without shutting off the pump. As a result, the remaining 1600 gallons of de-ionized water was pumped out of the tank.  The majority of the water went into the amine treater.  As a result ~40-120 gallons overflowed onto the ground. The overflow volume of mostly water with some amine solution spilled onto the ground immediately around the amine treating unit and did not leave the fenced site (an area of ~80' x 100' area was affected).

The well makes almost 100% water.  Our well tests show 1 BO per week production and approximately 300 BWPD.  The stained area was believed to have occured over a short period of time - maybe 3-4 days.  It was believed to be less than 1 barrel of primarily produced water.  Upon notification of the leak, PCR responded immediately.  The leak was repaired and the stained soil was scraped to a depth of 8-12 inches and the stained soil was removed and disposed of by E3 Solutions and taken to a Waste Management Facility (field ticket attached).

There was a single 300 bbl oil tank on the facility. We discovered the tank has evidently been leaking through several very small holes as evidenced by the saturation directly beneath the tank when it was removed. There was no surface staining to indicate any leak existed and it appears this saturation is isolated to where the tank was set. Initial excavation does not indicate significant outward migration but some downward penetration.  We have begun removal of the obviously contaminated soil and will find the perimeters of the saturation tomorrow.  Initial onsite soil testing will be conducted as soon as possible. The contamination is inside the berm area but waddles and a barrier fence have been placed for safety and containment.

The fact that new lines were put in service denotes the previous operators knowledge that the lines had failed, yet they made no effort to remove the failed lines or clean the contaminated area. It is clear that the contamination we are seeing is due to the failure of these abandoned lines, not due to the flowline leak we had recently repaired as previously thought. Since we have not found any lines near surface, the excavator trenched the top 2 feet of soil along the perimeter to expedite the hydrovac operations. We should have the perimeter fully potholed today.

The staff immediately responded to the can and shut off a 4"" valve to stop the water flow coming from a failed valve and split riser. The 1"" valve that failed is located between the Federal 11-90-24 #1 well head and the 4"" water line valve, which is now shut. Failure of the 1"" valve in the can, below the surface allowed water to enter the 1"" riser that comes out of the top of the can. Due to freezing temperatures, the water in the 1"" riser froze and caused a split in the 1"" riser pipe. Water then flowed out of the 1"" riser pipe, onto the top of the can, and then onto the ground surface and then traveled approximatley 75' down gradient where it stopped. No water features were impacted or close to being impacted. SG is in the process of installing wattles downslope of visible surface water staining, replacing the 1"" valve and 1"" riser."

Management evaluated the situation and cannot confirm a cause, however, an educated guess is being made that the belowground dump line developed corrosion at the 90 degree angle, located just outside the tank ring (again, below ground). Produced water was not flowing so containment was not necessary, however, wattles have been installed for stormwater controls during excavation activities. Excavation of the stained soil will begin tomorrow morning (9/20) when the equipment arrives. The first phase will involve removal of stained soil, stockpiling stained soil on a bermed and tarped area on the well pad location, and grabbing soil samples.

During the shutdown, 2 leaking valves on the amine contact tower allowed high-pressure to migrate into a low-pressure portion of the process. The pressure increased in the amine flash tank causing a pressure relief valve to open sending pressure to a sump tank that contained the methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) mixture. The sump pump in the sump tank did not function as expected due to a tripped breaker, nor did an alarm indicate a high tank level. The incoming pressure in to the full sump tank ultimately forced the MDEA mixture out of the thief hatch and onto the ground where it was discovered.
